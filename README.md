This Tic Tac Toe game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a 3x3 grid for two players, X and O. The objective is to align three marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. HTML structures the board, CSS handles styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript manages the game logic, determining turns, checking for winners or ties, and resetting the board for replay. It’s a simple, interactive, and responsive game for all devices.
